<p>Umple files conventionally use the extension .ump. To create a model or 
a system you would use one or more of the following tools to view, edit 
and compile .ump files.</p>

<ul>

<li><b>Eclipse.</b> To use Umple with Eclipse, you need to load an Umple 
Eclipse plugin. This can be obtained from our <a 
href="https://github.com/umple/Umple/releases/tag/v.1.22.0.5146>downloads site</a>. 
Note there is a plain plugin and a plugin enhanced with the XText 
technology that gives context-assist to help you program or model with 
fewer errors.</li>

<br />

<li><b>UmpleOnline.</b> <a href="http://try.umple.org">UmpleOnline</a> 
allows you to instantly experiment with Umple on the web. You can explore 
examples or create your own and save them in the "cloud". You can generate 
code as well as several other outputs. <a href="UsingUmpleOnline.html">The UmpleOnline section of this User manual describes how to use UmpleOnline</a>.</li>

<br />

<li><b>Command-line based compiler</b> You can always use Umple from the 
command line, typically from an ant script. Simply <a
href="https://github.com/umple/Umple/releases/tag/v.1.22.0.5146">download the latest 
officially released version of the umple jar</a>, and run it as "java -jar umple.jar *.ump".</li>
